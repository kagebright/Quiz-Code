# 4 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
This week's assignment is coding a quiz app online using JavaScript. In this week's assignment, I will be building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app is built to run in the browser with HTML and CSS that is powered by JavaScript.
This assignment is by far the most challenging work I had to do since I started coding but Im gladly looking forward to what I create.
